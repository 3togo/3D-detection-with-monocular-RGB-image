Note: I did the 3D detection research during my internship in MEGVII and most codes including training, testing, lib codes are not allowed posted
online, because the codes contains the basemodel and framework information. I want to share my viewpoint and some thoughts about 3D detection
with monoculr RGB images, so I decide to post the code used for predicting location information in 3D space with 2D boxes after being addimitted by mentor.
The code only uses Numpy and math module.
